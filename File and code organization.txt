How the files are organized

MY_PROJECT_PATH (highest-level folder)
- .py codes
- Fonts (folder)
	- .ttf files
- Single letter training set (folder)
	- .png files
- (other folders that I haven't thought of yet)

I put all developer-dependent variables in dev_constants.py. Feel free to add your own constants that you think are necessary. This should be things that are specific to your own machine. Each of us should have a local copy of this file, with the constants being modified to fit his/her environment.

Import this as a package at the beginning of your code.

For example,
MY_PROJECT_PATH is the path where you put all the code in. For me it is 'C:\\Users\\Yijun\\Python\\CS229'. So when I load data, I change MY_PROJECT_PATH to this string, and my code looks like
- Beginning of code
import dev_constants

(some other codes)
path = dev_constants.MY_PROJECT_PATH
fullFileDir = os.path.join(path, 'Single letter training set', fileName)
- End of code

So that when you run the same piece of code, you don't need to change anything but go to dev_constants.py and change the value of MY_PROJECT_PATH.

Same logic for the other variables (if any) in dev_constants.py.


Naming convension
Java naming convention is used, because we like lowerCamelCase.
- class name		should start with uppercase letter and be a noun e.g. String, Color, Button, System, Thread etc.
- interface name	should start with uppercase letter and be an adjective e.g. Runnable, Remote, ActionListener etc.
- method name	should start with lowercase letter and be a verb e.g. actionPerformed(), main(), print(), println() etc.
- variable name	should start with lowercase letter e.g. firstName, orderNumber etc.
- package name	should be in lowercase letter e.g. java, lang, sql, util etc.
- constants name	should be in uppercase letter. e.g. RED, YELLOW, MAX_PRIORITY etc.
